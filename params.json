  "body": "#Introduction\r\n\r\nA possible concept for Dataspace going forward is a set of interoperable repository building strategies that leverage standards compliant practices. By interacting with the INCF community, we hope facilitate data discovery and sharing across heterogeneous distributed data sources. Organizations can expose their metadata for harvesting via an OAI-PMH API, as well as other RESTful APIs. This will allow for the creation of data portals ( using CKAN, for example ) that enable curation of datasets, while allow organizations to make their own decisions in regards to critical infrastructure decisions, such as storage and delivery platforms.\r\n\r\nWe propose establishing a community process to develop a Minimal Information for Neuroscience Data Standard (MINDS).\r\n\r\nThis metadata model should be sufficient to uniquely identify a neuroscience dataset and find similar or related datasets. All metadata definitions should have an entry in the KnowledgeSpace. As a starting point we propose the following properties and standards:\r\n\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"  src=\"docson/widget.js\" data-schema=\"/hbp-data-schemas/neuroinformatics/hbp_prov/hbp-prov-schema-v3.0.json\" ></script>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy using these open community-based standards, data managers will be able to leverage other efforts, such as integrating NIF ontologies and the KnowledgeSpace lexicon service to enrich description.\r\n\r\nAs a starting out, we have proposed an initial schema to capture metadata generated in neuroinformatics lab activities. This schema is not to be seen covering all use cases.\r\n\r\n#Contact Us\r\n\r\nPlease leave us your comments, concerns, or suggestions either in the Issues section of the github repository or via email to chris at incf dot org. \r\n",
